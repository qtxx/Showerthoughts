## About

A subreddit for you to share all those thoughts, ideas, or philosophical questions that race through your head when in the shower.

Showerthought is a loose term that applies to any thought you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming.

Please be respectful of others submissions, if you disagree - explain why in the comments. Rudeness is unacceptable.

## Rules

- All content must be original. Unoriginal or reposted content will be removed.

- No shower "observations".

- No puns/wordplay.

- No jokes.

- No 'life pro tips'.

- Ideas for reddit features should be posted in /r/IdeasForTheAdmins.

- No politically motivated posts

- Don't be a jerk.

> Exceedingly nonsensical or common posts will be removed at the discretion of the mods (including posts that would fit better in other subreddits).

> **This subreddit is moderated for quality**, which means we remove content that we deem to be low quality, low effort, nonsensical, or common/unoriginal. We do not "let the votes decide". We understand that this type of policy is controversial and uncommon, especially for default subreddits, but we believe this method of moderation gives a subreddit the best chance at maintaining quality.
